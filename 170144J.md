## Blockchain concepts

### Consensus

Blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer technology. All nodes in the network have to agree on the state of chain and what are its valid blocks. Since there's no centralized control, and nodes cannot be trusted, reaching this agreement is not trivial. Every blockchain implementation must therefore define what's called a consensus algorithm to arrive at an agreement. This is also called consensus protocol.

### Distributed Ledger

Blockchain is one type of a distributed ledger. Distributed ledgers use independent computers (referred to as nodes) to record, share and synchronize transactions in their respective electronic ledgers (instead of keeping data centralized as in a traditional ledger). Blockchain organizes data into blocks, which are chained together in an append only mode.
